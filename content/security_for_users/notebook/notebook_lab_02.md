In this notebook, you will assume the role of a DevOps Engineer. You will pick up the model trained by the data scientists and deploy it as an endpoint.  You will also set up model monitoring on the endpoint for detecting data drift. 

As a best practice, you will commit the notebook to a git repo that is already provisioned, and call SageMaker Experiments APIs to track any model metadata, container artifacts, data and code lineage from the raw code to the production endpoint.

Let's get started.
