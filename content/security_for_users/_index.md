In this module we will introduce you to the recommended practices for using Amazon SageMaker in a secure data science environment.  Like many other AWS services, Amazon SageMaker is secure by default.  Throughout this workshop we will show you how you can work in a secured data science environment.  We will cover the many stages of the machine learning lifecycle and provide Jupyter notebooks to step through that lifecycle while maintaining a high bar for security.

Let's get started.
