To work through these labs you will need:

 - **An AWS account**

     With privileges to create IAM roles, attach IAM policies, create AWS VPCs, configure Service Catalog, create Amazon S3 buckets, and work with Amazon SageMaker.

 - **Access to the [AWS web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)**

     Many of the instructions will guide you through working with the various service consoles.  

To get the most of these labs it will be beneficial if you have prior experience working with the following technologies:

 - **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**

   Python is a programming language that is popular in data science communities.  It has been used in the labs to work with the AWS services and the data being used to train machine learning models.

 - **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**

   The labs make use of Git to manage the work you will complete.  Git is a distributed version control system and you will use a few simple commands to interact with a Git repository during the labs.

 - **[SageMaker SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io)**

   SageMaker SDK is a high-level Python SDK wrapped around Boto3 and designed to provide a familiar interface to data science users.

 - **[Boto3](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/)**

   Boto3 is a low-level Python SDK for interacting with the AWS APIs.  Documentation on its many great classes and functionality can be found [online](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/)

 - **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**

   The notebooks use Pandas in many different places to load, export, and manipulate data.  If you are unfamiliar with the Pandas library it may be helpful to review some of their [Getting Started](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html) materials.

 - **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org)**

 - **[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io)**

 - **[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)**
   
   You will use Jupyter notebooks to complete these labs.  If you have not used [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) before you may find a [Jupyter cheat sheet](https://www.edureka.co/blog/cheatsheets/jupyter-notebook-cheat-sheet) to be useful.  The cheat sheet walks through navigation of the Jupyter interface and how to use a notebook.

Now, let's get started!
